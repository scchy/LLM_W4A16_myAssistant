If your inhaler does not count down, call your pharmacist or doctor.\n\t4\tHold the inhaler away from your mouth and breathe out as far as you comfortably can. Do not breathe out into the mouthpiece.\n\t5\tPut the mouthpiece between your lips, and close your lips firmly around it. Take a long, steady, deep breath in through your mouth. Do not breathe in through your nose. Be careful not block the air vent with your fingers.\n\t6\tRemove the inhaler from your mouth, and hold your breath for about 3 to 4 seconds or as long as you comfortably can. Breathe out slowly.\n\t7\tYou may or may not taste or feel the medicine released by the inhaler. Even if you do not, do not inhale another dose. If you are not sure you are getting your dose of fluticasone and vilanterol, call your doctor or pharmacist.\n\t8\tYou may clean the mouthpiece with a dry tissue, if needed. Slide the cover up over the mouthpiece as far as it will go to close the inhaler.\n\t9\tRinse your mouth with water, but do not swallow.\nAsk your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient."

The herbs that showed the greatest potential to interact with warfarin include garlic, ginger, ginkgo, St. John's wort, and ginseng, i.e. plants normally consumed as food and also used for therapeutic purposes. The interactions between drugs and herbs are varied because of the complex chemical matrix of plants. Mainly coumarins, quinones, xanthones, terpenes, lignans, and vitamin K showed significant influence on warfarin treatment. In general, these plants can potentiate the effect of warfarin by stimulating anticoagulation in multiple ways, and the clinical outcome associated with this interaction is the increase of bleeding risk."

                "output": "A research team at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital has verified that several antidepressants may increase the risk of a potentially dangerous heart rhythm disturbance (arrhythmia). By examining the electrocardiograms (ECGs) of more than 38,000 people taking 11 different antidepressants, they confirmed that higher doses of citalopram (Celexa), amitriptyline (Elavil), and escitalopram (Lexapro) were associated with a slight disruption of the electrical function of the heart. This delay as seen on an ECG is known as a prolonged Q-T interval, and it is a risk factor for an arrhythmia that causes sudden death. Although the majority of people with this ECG abnormality never develop an arrhythmia, the researchers cautioned that people taking these antidepressants should discuss the risk with their doctor. The researchers emphasized that no one with a history of arrhythmias should start taking these medications. Instead, such a patient might try one of the antidepressants that do not increase the Q-T interval: fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), or buproprion (Wellbutrin). The study was published Jan. 29, 2013, in the journal BMJ."
